# PYBER ANALYSIS

## OVERVIEW OF THE ANALYSIS
PyBer is a ride-sharing app company.
The purpose of this analysis is to use matplotlib to visualize a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data from PyBer by three city types: urban, suburban and rural. Our output shows the total weekly fares for each city type as well as the total number of rides, drivers, fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver for each type of city. This analysis helps us identify how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used to make decisions.

## RESULTS
The results are illustrated in the following table and graph:

It is clear that rural areas have the least number of rides but the highest fare per ride. This can be alloted to the fact that there is a lower amount of drivers and the distances are longer.

On the other hand, urban cities have the largest amounts of rides and drivers but the average fares are lower. This can be alloted to the fact that there is a high offer of drivers and the distances may be shorter.

It is also important to note that the number of fares by date did not differ much throughout the months that were analyzed. We can assume that PyBer's usage is not affected by any time variables such as the school calendar or holidays.

## SUMMARY

Because the purpose of this analysis was to draw conclusions that could help the company make a bigger profit we can recommend the following changes:
1. Given that the supply of drivers in rural areas is so low, PyBer could offer incentives to prospects. Given that PyBer's workforce is part of the 'gig economy' they could offer paid vacation, 401k or other incentives that would persuade a fast-food worker, for example, to join PyBer.
2. Another option is to make some changes to urban city rides. The supply of drivers and the demand for rides are so high that it would be interesting to explore the option of having "surge timeframes". A surge timeframe would mean that during periods of the week/day where the demand for rides is high, the fare per ride would increase to keep up to pace with the demand for rides. If somebody is leaving a bar at 2am they will need a ride, even if this means that the average fare goes from $24 to $35. PyBer should explore the option of activating these momentary fare increases to conclude how much more a client is willing to pay without decreasing the average number of rides for urban cities.
3. An aspect of this analysis that was not explored is how the date can affect PyBer's results. The purpose of this project was to analyze ride-sharing information between January and April. Given that people tend to travel during the holidays it would be useful to know how much the number of rides increase between June — August and October — December. If the results show that there is a considerable surge, PyBer could take advantage of the "surge timeframes" suggested in the previous point and increase profits during busy seasons.
